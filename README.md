### This repo contains the game "Ray's Shisha Lounge" which is a IronHack Week 3 Project.
The player is asked to place a bet on a certain number between 2 an 12. Pressing "ROLL!!" will generate two random numbers between 1 and 6, resembling the roll of two dies. Pressing "ROLL!!" wil also start the music. Each number is added into a total that is compared to the player'sser's bet. If the total equals the bet, the player wins and a "Bro, You Win!"-message is displayed. If not, the player looses and a "Bro, You Loose!"-message is displayed.
